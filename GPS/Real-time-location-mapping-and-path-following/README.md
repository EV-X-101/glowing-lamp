# Real-Time Mapbox Path Tracer in PyQt

This is a Python application that displays a Mapbox map using PyQt. It allows the user to select a start and end point on the map, calculates the route between these points using the Mapbox Directions API, and displays a car marker that moves along the route in real-time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- PyQt5
- PyQtWebEngine
- Mapbox account (for the Mapbox access token and Directions API)
- Internet connection

## Installation

1. Install Python on your machine if you haven't already. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install the required Python libraries PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine. You can install them using pip:

    ```
    pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine
    ```

3. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/EV-X-101/Real-time-location-mapping-and-path-following.git
    ```

4. Sign up for a free account on Mapbox's website and get your Mapbox access token: https://www.mapbox.com/

5. Replace `'your_mapbox_token'` in the Python script with your actual Mapbox access token.

## Usage

Run the Python script:

```
python mapbox_app.py
```

Click on the map to set the start point (marked in green), then click again to set the end point (marked in red). The application will calculate the route and display it on the map. The blue marker represents the car's current position and will move along the route in real-time.

## Note

This is a basic implementation and does not include any error handling or optimization. You should add these in a production environment. Also, you need to replace the `calculateAndSetRoute` method with an actual call to the Mapbox Directions API.
